                Pleasure of answering Stack Overflow
            </div>

            <p>
                Stack Overflow (SO) is a question and answer site where users can ask programming specific questions and answer them.
                This site is dedicated to programmers. Big round of applause to Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood for this awesome creation.
                There are other sites where programmers can go whenever they are stuck,
                but none have the gamification model and user interface quite as perfected as this site.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have extensively used SO for my professional career over the past years.
                I recently started answering questions and have been completely hooked.
                Its amazing feeling to work with someone trying to find solution for them and occasionally get that “thanks that worked :)” comment.
                It does take good amount of time and effort to be able to produce answers that the community would appreciate by votes, and in return,
                there are few benefits.

            </p>
            <p>
                I have worked in multiples stacks over the years.
                I never truly had chance to reflect on the knowledge that I have acquired over the years.
                It has always been one project after another.
                In SO I often find people stuck on same issues that I was.
                Trying to get the answer for them, helps me remember the information that I had some what forgotten.
                This process has been gratifying.

            </p>

            <p>
                Apart from the knowledge, there is fun aspect of answering questions.
                Stack overflow has awesome gamification model.
                You accumulate points by answering or asking questions.
                As you rack up those points and commit various tasks, you get privileges and badges.
                Privileges really make you feel like you are a part of the community.
                And badges are recognition and bragging rights.
                A user’s points and badges are displayed right below the username, which speaks for the experience of the user in the site.
                Higher the points, generally more knowledgeable the users are.
                This feels similar to online games that I have played.
            </p>

            <p>
                Going through other people’s code, in their questions and answers I would often find something that I didn’t know that existed.
                There is also a good feeling of mentorship.
                There have been many occasions where I would answer something and other users would guide me to a better efficient solution.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have been a member for about 35 days and so far, and have racked up 189 points.
                Currently I am working to achieve a bronze tag in MongoDB.
                Apparently, I have bunch of answers for people new to MongoDB.
