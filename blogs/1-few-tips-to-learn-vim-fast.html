            <p>
            A year ago, I tried learning VIM, and failed miserably. I tried for about 2 months and gave up.
            The approach I took was to learn basic commands then get familiar with the most used VIM commands, 5 commands per day, and kept a cheat sheet of Vim commands on my desk.
            It was clearly a wrong approach.
            About 5 weeks ago, I decided to give it a second try. I followed following steps and they were very effective.
                Following these steps one can be editing in VIM proficiently as soon as 1-2 weeks.

                        These are movement commands when you are in Command and Visual mode. Making these commands second nature has been absolutely crucial for my success.

                        These commands are so important that I am going to talk bunch on them. Feel free to skip.

                        Ok so on the first day of relearning VIM and after going through the online vim interactive tutorial. I started playing this game VIM adventures. Since I had played it in my first attempt, I completely ignored instructions and found myself stuck on the first level (where the lights go off, and you have to basically move around the maze). I ended up finishing that in about 20 mins, which felt like eternity really. Later when I went to practice other commands in the VIM editor, I noticed that I was in-general less frustrated. I realized that I was now expert with the movements. This is where the tiffany happened. Being able to move around is basic need for us, when we can’t do that, we feel absolutely helpless and get discouraged. This was my biggest mistake in the first attempt. I never gave enough time to these commands. Due to which even on my 6th week I would still make mistakes on my movement. Once I got this, things just started making sense. I was using VIM yeaaaaa!!!!

                    4.	To learn new commands ask yourself this question “Is there a better/faster way to do this?”

                        You will often hear this about VIM, “VIM… with speed of thought”.
                        Basically, means that there are lot of cool commands that can speed up your text editing.
                        If you find yourself doing same thing again and again, that takes bit of time, ask yourself the question “Is there a better way to do this?”
                        Generally, there would be, and it would be supported right out of the box.

                        Now you might not feel good about using VIM during work because it might affect your productivity. However, I did use it at my work starting from the 3rd day. I didn’t completely switch to VIM editor but installed VIM plugin in the IDE that we use at work. I would use basic commands that I know so far and other awesome shortcut keys provided by the IDE. Best of both worlds. I didn’t really experience any loss in productivity.
                        While for other text editing needs, like at home or taking notes at work, I would fully use VIM, no matter how much I was struggling.

            <p>
                I should note that on the 3rd day, and after much contemplation, I decided to purchase the full edition of VIM adventures. I completed the game in 4 days, the game is absolutely fun to play and I highly suggest it. Learning the VIM commands in the order the game introduced was pretty vital for me, and the game developer(s) should highly be praised for it. Though, I have to contradict the point and have to say that You should learn according to your needs and priority. The 100 most used VIM commands that I used in my first attempt was compiled by someone, and might have been useful for many, but not for me. So, you have to see what works for you, if you aren’t making steady progress, maybe change approach. Here is the link to the list regardless http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/100-vim-commands-every-programmer-should-know

            <p>
                After about two weeks of doing step 4 and 5, I realized at some point during my day that I wasn’t moving my hand to grab the mouse as much as I used to, I said to myself, OH THIS IS HAPPENING!!!
